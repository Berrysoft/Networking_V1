# I NEED HELP!!!
This implementation is **NOT** completed, especially `<experimental/io_context>`. I extremely need help.

Move code from *boost.asio* is OK, but please **DON'T** copy them. I would like standard(C++17)/Windows specified code in each single header.
# Networking_V1
An implementation of [Networking TS](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/n4734.pdf).

This implementation requires C++ 17 standard and MSVC. It isn't compatible with GCC because there's already one in libstdc++, though it isn't completed...
